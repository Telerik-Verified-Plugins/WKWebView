## 1. Description

_BETA_ - things may break, [please post your feedback :)](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/cordova-plugin-wkwebview/issues)

* Allows you to use the new WKWebView on iOS 8 (the simulator is supported as well).
* Falls back to UIWebView on iOS 7 and lower.
* Will hopefully cease to exist soon (when Apple releases a fixed WKWebView so Cordova can use it without the hacks I needed to apply).
* As a matter of fact, [Apache is working on a similar plugin (which you can't use at the moment of writing)](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugins/tree/master/wkwebview-engine) which I came across after releasing version 0.1.1. It targets Cordova 3.7.0 and up whereas this plugin is supported on 3.0.0 an up. 

### Take note!

* For a seamless upgrade to iOS9 this plugin wipes any existing `NSAppTransportSecurity` configuration you may have done (a new feature in iOS9) to allow communication with even HTTP (non-S) backends, like previous iOS versions did. You can and should configure access rules (`config.xml`) and use the whitelist plugin as before.
* [Ionic](http://ionicframework.com/) tip: to prevent flashes of a black background, make sure you set `ion-nav-view`'s `background-color` to `transparent`.
* If you need the [device plugin](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-device), use at least Cordova-iOS 3.6.3 (deviceready never fires with 3.5.0 due to a currently unknown reason).
* When making AJAX requests to a remote server make sure it supports CORS. See the [Telerik Verified Marketplace documentation](http://plugins.telerik.com/plugin/wkwebview) for more details on this and other valuable pointers. As a last resort you can add [this CORS-Proxy](https://github.com/gr2m/CORS-Proxy) between your app and the server.
* You can load files from the app's cache folders by using the entire path (/var/.../Library/...) or simply '/Library/..' (or '/Documents/..').
* This plugin features crash recovery: if the WKWebView crashes, it will auto-restart (otherwise you'd have an app with a blank page as it doesn't crash the app itself). Crash recovery requires a filled `<title>anything</title>` tag in your html files. If you want to disable this feature, set the `config.xml` property `DisableCrashRecovery` to `true`.
* In order to open links like `tel:` and `mailto:` you need to add `target="_blank"`: `<a href="tel:+31611223344" target="_blank">call!</a>`

## 2. Screenshot
This image shows the [SocialSharing plugin](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/SocialSharing-PhoneGap-Plugin) in action while running [a performance test](https://www.scirra.com/demos/c2/particles/) in an iframe on my iPhone 6 (older devices show an even larger difference).
It's a screenshot of the [demo app](demo/index.html).

## 3. Installation

From npm
```
$ cordova plugin add https://github.com/AlBusso/WKWebView.git
$ cordova prepare
```

No need for anything else - you can now open the project in XCode 6 if you like.

## 4. Changelog
* __0.6.2__  LocalStorage is copied from UIWebView to WKWebView again (iOS location was recently changed as it appears).
* __0.6.1__  Allow reading files from /tmp, so the camera plugin file URI's work. Thx #155.
* __0.6.0__  iOS9 (GM) compatibility. Also, compatibility with iOS8 devices when building with XCode 7 (iOS9 SDK). Dialogs (alert, prompt, confirm) were broken.
* __0.5.1__  Added support for `config.xml` property `DisableLocalStorageSyncWithUIWebView` (default `false`). Set it to `true` if you want to switch back to UIWebView and retain LS changes made while running WKWebView.
* __0.5.0__  iOS9 (beta) compatibility, keyboard scroll fix, white keyboard background if no specific color is specified (was black).
* __0.4.0__  Compatibility with Telerik LiveSync and LivePatch. Disabled the horizontal and vertical scrollbars. Added support for `config.xml` property `DisableCrashRecovery` (default `false`).
* __0.3.8__  Adding a way to access files in '/Library/' and '/Documents/' (simply use those prefixes), thanks #88!
* __0.3.7__  Custom URL Schemes did not work, see #98, also this version includes crash recovery, thanks #62!
* __0.3.6__  Bind embedded webserver to localhost so it can't be reached from the outside, thanks #64!
* __0.3.5__  Compatibility with the statusbar plugin: allow the statusbar to not overlay the webview, thanks #6 and #20!

* __0.3.1__  Compatibility with the SplashScreen plugin
* __0.3.0__  Enhanced loading files with the embedded HTTP server, thanks #36!
* __0.2.7__  Cut app startup time in half - not noticable unless you have a lot of files in your app, see #32
* __0.2.6__  `Config.xml` settings like `MediaPlaybackRequiresUserAction` (autoplay HTML 5 video) are now supported, see #25.
* __0.2.5__  Fixed a script error for Cordova 3.5.0 and lower, see #17.
* __0.2.4__  Compatibility with the `device` plugin on Cordova 3.5.0 and lower, see #17.
* __0.2.3__  Compatibility with the `close` function of the [Ionic Keyboard Plugin](https://github.com/driftyco/ionic-plugins-keyboard).
* __0.2.2__  Compatibility with plugins which use the superview of the 'classic' webview, like [ActivityIndicator](https://github.com/Initsogar/cordova-activityindicator)
* __0.2.1__  LocalStorage sync between UIWebView and WKWebView - on a real device as well
* __0.2.0__  LocalStorage sync between UIWebView and WKWebView - on a simulator only
* __0.1.3__  Compatibility with [InAppBrowser](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-inappbrowser)
* __0.1.2__  Compatibility with plugins like [Toast](https://github.com/EddyVerbruggen/Toast-PhoneGap-Plugin) which add a subview to the webview (they didn't show)
* __0.1.1__  Cleanup to get rid of a few (deprecation) warnings - lots left (on purpose) because they're thrown by a 3rd party framework and can be safely ignored
* __0.1.0__  Added support for loading local files via XHR. This should now transparently work for $.ajax, AngularJS templateUrl's, etc. To this end the plugin adds an embedded HTTP server on port 12344 which is stopped when the app is put to sleep or exits.
* __0.0.1__  Initial version

This plugin was inspired by the hard work of the Apache Cordova team [(and most notably Shazron)](https://github.com/shazron/WKWebViewFIleUrlTest).
